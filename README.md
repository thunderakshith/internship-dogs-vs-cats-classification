# Dogs vs Cats Image Classification

This project is an AI/deep learning application that trains a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Objective
To learn and implement an end-to-end deep learning workflow using
TensorFlow and Keras for image classification.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- TensorFlow / Keras
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Dataset
